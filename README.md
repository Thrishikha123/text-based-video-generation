Text-Based Video Generation Using AI

This project demonstrates text-to-video generation using deep learning and pretrained generative models.  
Given a natural language text prompt, the system generates a short video that visually represents the described scene.

The implementation is done using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging modern multimodal AI models.

Introduction
Text-based video generation is a rapidly evolving field in multimodal artificial intelligence, where systems learn to generate videos from textual descriptions.  
This project explores how pretrained AI models can be used to transform simple text prompts into short video clips.

The focus of this repository is experimentation and learning, rather than training models from scratch.

Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To understand how text-to-video generation models work  
- To implement a working pipeline for generating videos from text  
- To experiment with AI-generated multimedia content  
- To demonstrate practical use of generative AI models
